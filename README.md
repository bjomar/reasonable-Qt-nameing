# reasonable-Qt-nameing

This small and stupid wrapper redefines all listed Qt5.11 classes (taken from here: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/classes.html) to more, seemingly reasonable names,  including a removal of the annoying leading 'Q'. Have fun with it.

If there are any suggestions, don't hesitate to suggest, but don't expect me to check this regulary.
